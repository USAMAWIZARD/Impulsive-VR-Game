SMPLRT_DIV[7:0]

 Divides the internal sample rate (see register CONFIG) to generate the
sample rate that controls sensor data output rate, FIFO sample rate.
NOTE: This register is only effective when Fchoice = 2’b11 (fchoice_b
register bits are 2’b00), and (0 < dlpf_cfg < 7), such that the average filter’s
output is selected (see chart below).
This is the update rate of sensor register.
SAMPLE_RATE= Internal_Sample_Rate / (1 + SMPLRT_DIV)

ACCEL_FS_SEL[1:0]
Accel Full Scale Select:
±2g (00), ±4g (01), ±8g (10), ±16g (11)



GYRO_FS_SEL[1:0]
Gyro Full Scale Select:
00 = +250dps
01= +500 dps
10 = +1000 dps
11 = +2000 dps

[2:0] A_DLPFCFG Accelerometer low pass filter setting as shown in table 2 below. 

GYRO_XOUT
1 – Write GYRO_XOUT_H and GYRO_XOUT_L to the FIFO at the sample
rate; If enabled, buffering of data occurs even if data path is in standby.
0 – function is disabled
[5] GYRO_YOUT
1 – Write GYRO_YOUT_H and GYRO_YOUT_L to the FIFO at the sample
rate; If enabled, buffering of data occurs even if data path is in standby.
0 – function is disabled
NOTE: Enabling any one of the bits corresponding to the Gyros or Temp data paths,
data is buffered into the FIFO even though that data path is not enabled.
[4] GYRO_ZOUT
1 – Write GYRO_ZOUT_H and GYRO_ZOUT_L to the FIFO at the sample
rate; If enabled, buffering of data occurs even if data path is in standby.
0 – function is disabled
[3] ACCEL
1 – write ACCEL_XOUT_H, ACCEL_XOUT_L, ACCEL_YOUT_H,
ACCEL_YOUT_L, ACCEL_ZOUT_H, and ACCEL_ZOUT_L to the FIFO at
the sample rate;
0 – function is disabled

The internal registers and memory of the MPU-9250 can be accessed using either I2C at 400 kHz or SPI at
1MHz. SPI operates in four-wire mode.
	
To prevent switching into I2C mode when using SPI, the I2C interface should be disabled by setting the
I2C_IF_DIS configuration bit
Setting this bit should be performed immediately after waiting for the time
specified by the “Start-Up Time for Register Read/Write” in Section 6.3
